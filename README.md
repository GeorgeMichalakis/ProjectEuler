# About
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Problems

### Problem1 (Solved)

#### Question

If we list all the natuural numbers below 10 that are multipels of 3 and 5 we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.

#### Solution
Apart from the typical brute force for loop, we can think of something a bit more sophisticated. There is a formula for O(1) computation of the amount of numbers below N that are multiples of a number X.
